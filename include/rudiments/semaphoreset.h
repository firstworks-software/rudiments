/** Semaphores allow processes to synchronize their activities.
 *
 *  A semaphore is just a number with two primary operations that can be 
 *  performed on it: signal() and wait()
 *  
 *  The operations are analagous to:
 * 
 *  int32_t	semaphore;
 * 
 *  void	signal() {
 *  	semaphore++;		// increment the semaphore
 *  }
 * 
 *  void	wait() {
 *  	while (semaphore<=0);	// wait until the semaphore>0
 *  	semaphore--;		// decrement the semaphore
 *  }
 * 
 *  The actual signal() and wait() operations are atomic.  There is no chance 
 *  of another process getting context-switched in and changing the semaphore 
 *  value between the two lines of code in the wait() process.
 * 
 *  Semaphores can be initialized to any number.
 *  
 *  The initial value of the semaphore corresponds to the number of processes
 *  that will pass directly through their wait() calls without being blocked.
 * 
 *  Processes that get blocked calling wait() are placed in a queue.  When 
 *  another process calls signal(), the process at the head of the queue is 
 *  unblocked.
 * 
 *  A semaphoreset is just a collection of related semaphores.
 * 
 *  A semaphoreset is owned by a user and group and has access permissions
 *  just like a file. */
