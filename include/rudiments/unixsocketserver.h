/** The unixsocketserver class allows you to write programs that can talk to
 *  other programs on the same machine over TCP stream sockets.
 * 
 *  Inet sockets (see the inetsocketserver class) can be used by clients and
 *  servers on the same machine as well, but Unix sockets generally perform
 *  better.
 *
 *  Some platforms (line Windows) don't support Unix sockets.  For those
 *  platforms, Unix sockets are simulated using Inet sockets on localhost
 *  by translating the socket filename to a port.  See
 *  unixsocketutil::filenameToPort() for details.
 * 
 *  The unixsocketserver class provides methods for setting up sockets and
 *  accepting client connections.  Its ultimate parent class: transport,
 *  provides methods for reading and writing data and closing connections.
 *  An immediate parent class: unixsocket provides methods for passing file
 *  descriptors between connected instances of unixservertsocket's and
 *  unixsocketclient's.
 * 
 *  If you need to listen on more than 1 socket at a time, you should use the 
 *  unixsocketserver class (and possibly the unixsocketserver class) in
 *  conjunction with the listener class. */
