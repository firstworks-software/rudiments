/** The randomnumber class provides methods for generating and scaling 
 *  random numbers.
 * 
 *  Superfluous background:
 * 
 *  There is no such thing as true randomness.   Many random number generators
 *  just return values from a highly divergent series.  Others collect "entropy"
 *  from system hardware returning numbers that are actually associated with
 *  system activity but in an indiscernible way.  In most cases, entropy-based
 *  systems are just used to seed systems that return values from a highly
 *  divergnet series.
 *
 *  If there is only one running process generating random numbers using a
 *  highly divergent series, successive calls to generate() will never return
 *  the same value until all numbers between 0 and the number returned by
 *  getRandMax() (usually 2^31-1 but could be 2^32-1 or 2^15-1 on some systems)
 *  have been returned.  At that point, the entire sequence will repeat.
 *
 *  Calls to generate() with lower/upper parameters may return the same value
 *  before all numbers in the range have been returned because it just scales
 *  the result of generate() without lower/upper parameters which operates on a
 *  larger range. */
