/** Permissions are access priveleges.  Files, directories, semaphores and
 *  shared memory segments all have permissions associated with them.
 * 
 *  There are 3 types of permissions: read, write and execute.
 * 
 *  These permissions can be granted to:
 *  	1. The user that owns the object.
 *  	2. Other users in the group of the user that owns the object.
 *  	3. All other users.
 * 
 *  The execute permission has 2 modifications which can be applied to it:
 *  	1. Set user id - the program will run as the user that owns
 * 			it instead of as the user that ran it
 *  	1. Set group id - the program will run as the group that owns
 * 			it instead of as the group of the user that ran it
 * 
 *  The "sticky bit" may also be set on platforms that support it.  When set,
 *  the file is saved in the system's swap space. As a side-effect, it cannot
 *  be deleted by a user other than the one that created it. */
