/** The unixsocketclient class allows you to write programs that can talk to
 *  other programs on the same machine over TCP stream sockets.
 * 
 *  Inet sockets (see the inetsocketclient class) can be used by clients and
 *  servers on the same machine as well, but Unix sockets generally perform
 *  better.
 *
 *  Some platforms (line Windows) don't support Unix sockets.  For those
 *  platforms, Unix sockets are simulated using Inet sockets on localhost
 *  by translating the socket filename to a port.  See
 *  unixsocketutil::filenameToPort() for details.
 * 
 *  The unixsocketclient class provides methods for connecting to servers.
 *  Its ultimate parent class: filedescriptor provides methods for reading and 
 *  writing data and closing connections. */
