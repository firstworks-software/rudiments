/** The inetsocketserver class allows you to write programs that can talk to

 *  accepting client connections.  Its ultimate parent class, filedescriptor,
 *  provides methods for reading and writing data and closing connections.
 * 
 *  If you need to listen on more than one socket at a time or a combination
 *  of sockets and other file descriptors, then you should use the
